# Giphy-Project

#### Welcome to my Pokemon Giphy application! You really can look up any other giphy's. But Pokemon is what I chose for the theme. It is really simple to use. You can click on the pre-generated buttons on the screen. Or you can add a button based on the giphy you would like to search. It will only display 10 items of your search.

## Programs
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Jquery

## Command Rules
* Choose the defaulted buttons OR,
* Enter the giphy you would like to search.
